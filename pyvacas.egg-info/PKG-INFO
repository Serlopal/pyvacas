Description: # PyVacas
        
        A lightweight module that provides easy access to all national, regional and local holidays in Spain using a Pandas dataframe format.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the module using
        
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/Serlopal/pyvacas.git
        ```
        
        Alternatively, if you'd rather use the module from your local project folder, you can just clone the repo and 
        make sure you install the Python dependencies with
        
        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can fetch all available holidays for Spain using ```get_holidays``` without any extra arguments
        
        ```python
        from pyvacas import HolidaysCalendar
        
        cal = HolidaysCalendar()
        holidays = cal.get_holidays()
        ```
        
        Or check out available provinces and municipalities using ```list_provinces``` or ```list_municipalities``` and provide them to
        ```get_holidays``` to retrieve only the holidays for the desired locations.
        
        ```python
        from pyvacas import HolidaysCalendar
        
        cal = HolidaysCalendar()
        holidays = cal.get_holidays(provinces="Madrid")
        ```
        
        You can provide a single item using a string or multiple ones in the form of lists. If you choose to provide both provinces and municipalities,
        the holidays will be filtered so that they are coincident for both of them.
        
        
        ```HolidaysCalendar``` checks at creation time for the availability of holiday data already cached inside the library. If the data is not present,
        the program will automatically start scrapping the data from the web. In case the data is present but the user wants to refresh it for any reason,
        this can be done using the ```re_scrape_data``` method.
        
        ```python
        from pyvacas import HolidaysCalendar
        
        cal = HolidaysCalendar()
        cal.re_scrape_data()
        ```
